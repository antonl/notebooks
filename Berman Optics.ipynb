Similarly, it makes sense why the field causes rotations about it - the driving behavior is $\\pi/2$ out of phase with the response, just like in the SHO case.

      "> The term absorption can be a bit misleading. What does it mean for optical radiation to be absorbed by a medium? A perfectly reasonable definition would be that the incident energy is transformed into internal energy of the medium, as can happen in solids and liquids. In this case, the medium would heat as a result of the absorption. On the other hand, when light is incident on a low-density atomic vapor, a different type of process occurs. The radiation results in some steady- state excited-state population of the atoms that can be viewed as heating, but this heating is a transient process. Once the steady-state population is established, there is no additional heating; nevertheless, the incident field continues to lose energy. The energy loss mechanism involves scattering of the incident field by the atoms into unoccupied modes of the vacuum field. Neglecting atomic motion, the average frequency of this scattered radiation is always the frequency of the incident field and not the atomic transition frequency, consistent with a scattering interpretation. We discuss this interpretation in greater detail in Chapter 20. Thus, when we talk of absorption in this section and throughout the text, we actually refer to the loss of energy by the incident field and not to an increase in energy of the medium.\n"
